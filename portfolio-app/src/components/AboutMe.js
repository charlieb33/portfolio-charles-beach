                <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always been curious as to what makes things tick.
                    My thirst for knowledge, challenges, and self-improvement has to be one of my most qualities.
                    I am capable of teaching myself new things or building on my current capabilites relatively quick.

                </p>
                <p>Outside of programming, I have a passion for photography, video games, music, and movies, especially all things Marvel.
